**A tool for exploring a docker image, layer contents, and discovering ways to shrink the size of your Docker/OCI image.**


![Image](.data/demo.gif)

To analyze a Docker image simply run drive with an image tag/id/digest:
```bash
drive <your-image-tag>
```

or you can drive with docker command directly
```
alias drive="docker run -ti --rm  -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock khulnasoft/drive"
drive <your-image-tag>

# for example
drive nginx:latest
```

or if you want to build your image then jump straight into analyzing it:
```bash
drive build -t <some-tag> .
```

Building on Macbook (supporting only the Docker container engine)

```bash
docker run --rm -it \
      -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
      -v  "$(pwd)":"$(pwd)" \
      -w "$(pwd)" \
      -v "$HOME/.drive.yaml":"$HOME/.drive.yaml" \
      khulnasoft/drive:latest build -t <some-tag> .
```

Additionally you can run this in your CI pipeline to ensure you're keeping wasted space to a minimum (this skips the UI):
```
CI=true drive <your-image>
```

**This is beta quality!** *Feel free to submit an issue if you want a new feature or find a bug :)*

## Basic Features

**Show Docker image contents broken down by layer**

As you select a layer on the left, you are shown the contents of that layer combined with all previous layers on the right. Also, you can fully explore the file tree with the arrow keys.

**Indicate what's changed in each layer**

Files that have changed, been modified, added, or removed are indicated in the file tree. This can be adjusted to show changes for a specific layer, or aggregated changes up to this layer.

**Estimate "image efficiency"**

The lower left pane shows basic layer info and an experimental metric that will guess how much wasted space your image contains. This might be from duplicating files across layers, moving files across layers, or not fully removing files. Both a percentage "score" and total wasted file space is provided.

**Quick build/analysis cycles**

You can build a Docker image and do an immediate analysis with one command:
`drive build -t some-tag .`

You only need to replace your `docker build` command with the same `drive build`
command.

**CI Integration**

Analyze an image and get a pass/fail result based on the image efficiency and wasted space. Simply set `CI=true` in the environment when invoking any valid drive command.

**Multiple Image Sources and Container Engines Supported**

With the `--source` option, you can select where to fetch the container image from:
```bash
drive <your-image> --source <source>
```
or
```bash
drive <source>://<your-image>
```

With valid `source` options as such:
- `docker`: Docker engine (the default option)
- `docker-archive`: A Docker Tar Archive from disk
- `podman`: Podman engine (linux only)

## Installation

**Ubuntu/Debian**

Using debs:
```bash
DRIVE_VERSION=$(curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/khulnasoft/drive/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"v([^"]+)".*/\1/')
curl -OL https://github.com/khulnasoft/drive/releases/download/v${DRIVE_VERSION}/drive_${DRIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.deb
sudo apt install ./drive_${DRIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.deb
```

Using snap:
```bash
sudo snap install docker
sudo snap install drive
sudo snap connect drive:docker-executables docker:docker-executables
sudo snap connect drive:docker-daemon docker:docker-daemon
```

**RHEL/Centos**
```bash
DRIVE_VERSION=$(curl -sL "https://api.github.com/repos/khulnasoft/drive/releases/latest" | grep '"tag_name":' | sed -E 's/.*"v([^"]+)".*/\1/')
curl -OL https://github.com/khulnasoft/drive/releases/download/v${DRIVE_VERSION}/drive_${DRIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.rpm
rpm -i drive_${DRIVE_VERSION}_linux_amd64.rpm
```

**Arch Linux**

Available in the [extra repository](https://archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/drive/) and can be installed via [pacman](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Pacman):

```bash
pacman -S drive
```

**Mac**

If you use [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```bash
brew install drive
```

If you use [MacPorts](https://www.macports.org):

```bash
sudo port install drive
```

Or download the latest Darwin build from the [releases page](https://github.com/khulnasoft/drive/releases/latest).

**Windows**

Download the [latest release](https://github.com/khulnasoft/drive/releases/latest).

**Go tools**
Requires Go version 1.10 or higher.

```bash
go get github.com/khulnasoft/drive
```
*Note*: installing in this way you will not see a proper version when running `drive -v`.

**Nix/NixOS**

On NixOS:
```bash
nix-env -iA nixos.drive
```
On non-NixOS (Linux, Mac)
```bash
nix-env -iA nixpkgs.drive
```

**Docker**
```bash
docker pull khulnasoft/drive
```

or

```bash
docker pull quay.io/khulnasoft/drive
```

When running you'll need to include the docker socket file:
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    khulnasoft/drive:latest <drive arguments...>
```

Docker for Windows (showing PowerShell compatible line breaks; collapse to a single line for Command Prompt compatibility)
```bash
docker run --rm -it `
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock `
    khulnasoft/drive:latest <drive arguments...>
```

**Note:** depending on the version of docker you are running locally you may need to specify the docker API version as an environment variable:
```bash
   DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.37 drive ...
```
or if you are running with a docker image:
```bash
docker run --rm -it \
    -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
    -e DOCKER_API_VERSION=1.37 \
    khulnasoft/drive:latest <drive arguments...>
```

## CI Integration

When running drive with the environment variable `CI=true` then the drive UI will be bypassed and will instead analyze your docker image, giving it a pass/fail indication via return code. Currently there are three metrics supported via a `.drive-ci` file that you can put at the root of your repo:
```
rules:
  # If the efficiency is measured below X%, mark as failed.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1.
  lowestEfficiency: 0.95

  # If the amount of wasted space is at least X or larger than X, mark as failed.
  # Expressed in B, KB, MB, and GB.
  highestWastedBytes: 20MB

  # If the amount of wasted space makes up for X% or more of the image, mark as failed.
  # Note: the base image layer is NOT included in the total image size.
  # Expressed as a ratio between 0-1; fails if the threshold is met or crossed.
  highestUserWastedPercent: 0.20
```
You can override the CI config path with the `--ci-config` option.

## UI Configuration

No configuration is necessary, however, you can create a config file and override values:
```yaml
# supported options are "docker" and "podman"
container-engine: docker
# continue with analysis even if there are errors parsing the image archive
ignore-errors: false
log:
  enabled: true
  path: ./drive.log
  level: info

# Note: you can specify multiple bindings by separating values with a comma.
# Note: UI hinting is derived from the first binding
keybinding:
  # Global bindings
  quit: ctrl+c
  toggle-view: tab
  filter-files: ctrl+f, ctrl+slash

  # Layer view specific bindings
  compare-all: ctrl+a
  compare-layer: ctrl+l

  # File view specific bindings
  toggle-collapse-dir: space
  toggle-collapse-all-dir: ctrl+space
  toggle-added-files: ctrl+a
  toggle-removed-files: ctrl+r
  toggle-modified-files: ctrl+m
  toggle-unmodified-files: ctrl+u
  toggle-filetree-attributes: ctrl+b
  page-up: pgup
  page-down: pgdn

diff:
  # You can change the default files shown in the filetree (right pane). All diff types are shown by default.
  hide:
    - added
    - removed
    - modified
    - unmodified

filetree:
  # The default directory-collapse state
  collapse-dir: false

  # The percentage of screen width the filetree should take on the screen (must be >0 and <1)
  pane-width: 0.5

  # Show the file attributes next to the filetree
  show-attributes: true

layer:
  # Enable showing all changes from this layer and every previous layer
  show-aggregated-changes: false

```

drive will search for configs in the following locations:
- `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/drive/*.yaml`
- `$XDG_CONFIG_DIRS/drive/*.yaml`
- `~/.config/drive/*.yaml`
- `~/.drive.yaml`

`.yml` can be used instead of `.yaml` if desired.
